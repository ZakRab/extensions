# reroutr

**reroutr** is a Chrome extension I created to help myself stay focused and stop distracting myself online. With reroutr, you can easily reroute distracting websites to more productive ones, right from your browser toolbar.

## Why I made this

I found myself constantly visiting distracting sites when I should have been working or studying. reroutr lets me set up custom rules to automatically redirect those sites to something more useful, helping me stay on track.

## Features

- Instantly reroute any website to another
- Manage your reroute rules from the extension popup or options page
- Simple, clean interface

## Short Description (for Chrome Web Store)

> Reroute distracting websites to productive ones and stay focused. Instantly manage your custom redirect rules from the extension popup.

## How to use

1. Click the reroutr icon in your Chrome toolbar.
2. Add a rule: enter the site you want to reroute (e.g. `facebook.com`) and where you want to go instead (e.g. `wikipedia.org`).
3. Try visiting the distracting siteâ€”it will redirect you to your chosen productive site!
