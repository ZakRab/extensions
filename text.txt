I appreciate the opportunity to work with you on this project and understand that the initial version of the website may not have been exactly what you envisioned. 
My goal has always been to deliver a high-quality site that meets your expectations, and I’d love to find a way to move forward that works for both of us.  
As we neared the completion timeline, I reached out on January 21, 2025, requesting essential assets—including media, pictures, videos, logos, and bin locations—to refine the website.
 but unfortunately, I didn’t receive those materials. Without them, we worked with the best available resources to create a modern and functional website that included all the requirements outlined in the contract.
   Per our contract, the total payment of $2,500 is due upon completion of the project. However, I’m more than happy to make any necessary revisions.
    If you’d like to proceed with adjustments, and I’ll be glad to incorporate them. 
     If you prefer not to proceed with further changes, I kindly ask that the agreed-upon payment be made
     so we can close out the project smoothly. I truly appreciate your time and the opportunity to work on this with you, and I’d love to resolve this in a way that is fair for both of us
